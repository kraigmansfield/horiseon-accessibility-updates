# horiseon-accessibility-updates

## Description

This update changes some HTML div elements into semantic HTML elements.

- My motivation for completing this project was to address accessiblilty issues in using div's as opposed to using semantic HTML. 
- This project was built to address this issue.
- From this project, I learned how to add comments, how to condense css elements without changing the final product, and how to change old code into semantic html.
